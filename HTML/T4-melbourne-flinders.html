        <p>Flinders Street Railway Station at the corner of Flinders  and Swanston Streets is the oldest station in Australia (1910) although the  first station on this site opened in 1854!
        </p>
        <p>Flinders street is the busiest suburban railway station in  the southern hemisphere even after the completion of the city loop railway  subway and its 700 metre main platform is the longest in the country.
        </p>
        <p>Flinders Street Station is 'the' meeting place for  Melburnians, expressed simply as "meet me under the clocks", a  reference to the clocks above the main entrance.
